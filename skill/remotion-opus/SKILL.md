description: "Make premium 15-second launch / promo videos (landscape 1920x1080 + portrait 1080x1920, Remotion) with a few cheap API calls instead of an expensive agent loop. Opus 5.5 (via the Vikey API) picks a fresh concept, writes a JSON spec and reviews rendered frames; a fixed motion engine with three visual languages (3D fly-through, editorial poster, kinetic type) renders it. Use for model/product launches, price-drop announcements and feature promos."

# remotion-opus — Opus-grade launch videos from cheap models

You drive the `ros` CLI from https://github.com/direkturcrypto/remotion-opus-skill. You never write React or
animation code for a video: the engine owns camera, typography, easing, captions, SFX and both aspect ratios, and a
creative-director step makes every film look different from the last ones. Quality comes from three things you
control: **the brief, the facts, and following the loop.** Keep your own token use low: don't read the engine source
or the rendered images unless something fails — run the commands and read the short reports.

## 0. Setup (once)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/direkturcrypto/remotion-opus-skill.git && cd remotion-opus-skill
npm install
node bin/ros.mjs init        # creates .env, synthesizes SFX, checks ffmpeg
# edit .env: VIKEY_API_KEY=vk-…  (VIKEY_BASE_URL=https://api.vikey.ai/v1)
#            ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=…  (optional — voice-over eleven_v4 + music; without it: captions + SFX only)
node bin/ros.mjs doctor      # must show builder + verifier "✓ available"
```

`ros` below means `node bin/ros.mjs` run from the repo root.

## 1. Gather facts BEFORE anything else

Every number on screen (price, %, context size, version, benchmark) must be in `facts.md` with its source and
date — the linter rejects any on-screen number that is not in the facts. Read the official pages yourself
(pricing pages are often JS-rendered: use a browser tool, not a plain fetch). Write down what NOT to claim
(e.g. "official cache is cheaper — no cache discount"). Never claim "forever/selamanya", "unlimited", "fastest"
unless a source says so.

## 2. Create the project

```bash
ros new <slug> --brief "<what launches, for whom, the ONE message, required CTA line, language, brand + colour>"
# then edit projects/<slug>/facts.md (bullets: fact — source, date)
```

A good brief names: the product, the audience/angle, the single takeaway, the exact CTA if the client wants one
(e.g. must end with "pakai Vikey!"), language for VO and captions, brand name/url/colour, and things to avoid
(e.g. "no Xiaomi logo, model name as text").

## 3. Run the loop

```bash
ros run <slug>     # concept → plan → audio → review rounds (stills → Opus verify → fix) → render
```

Or step by step when you want control:

```bash
ros concept <slug>   # director picks engine/path/look/archetype/angle → concept.json (differs from recent films)
ros plan <slug>      # builder writes projects/<slug>/spec.json from the concept (retries until the linter passes)
ros lint <slug>      # schema + facts + cue + pacing + look-variety checks
ros audio <slug>     # ElevenLabs eleven_v4 VO (+ STT word timings) and music; SFX always
ros review <slug>    # up to MAX_ROUNDS of stills → Opus review → patch/fix
ros render <slug>    # MP4s in projects/<slug>/out/ + automatic frame-jump scan
```

## 4. Read the results — don't just trust the exit code

- `projects/<slug>/review/round-N/review.md` — Opus's verdict, score, issues. `sheet-L.jpg` / `sheet-P.jpg` are
  contact sheets of the frames it saw. Look at them yourself if your agent can see images.
- `ros render` prints "unexpected frame jump(s)" with frame numbers if something pops — render a still at that
  frame (`ros stills`) and look.
- VO: `ros audio` warns when STT didn't hear the brand name (TTS mispronounced it). Re-take one line with
  `ros audio <slug> --only m04 --force`, or rewrite the line so the brand ends the sentence.
- `ros usage <slug>` — tokens per model (the builder does the heavy writing; Opus only sees frames).

## 5. Editing a finished spec by hand

`spec.json` is the single source of truth. Allowed edits: copy, cue words, `look.preset`, `path`, `camera.zoom`,
`camera.moves`, `punches`, widget fields. After any edit: `ros lint <slug>` then `ros review <slug> --rounds 1`.
Widget catalog and limits: `prompts/builder.md`. Cue format: `"m02:gambar"` = the moment the word "gambar" is
spoken in VO line m02 (use words from the spoken `text`, not the caption).

## Rules

- Don't edit `src/engine` or `src/widgets` to fix one video — fix the spec. Engine changes are for everyone and
  need a full re-test of `ros example` + `ros render mimo-example`.
- Variety is enforced: the concept may not reuse the last film's engine or the last two looks
  (`projects/.history.json`). If the user wants a specific style, put it in the brief ("pakai gaya poster").
- Portrait and landscape always ship together.
- If the review keeps failing on the same issue after 3 rounds, stop and report the issue + the contact sheet
  to the user instead of looping.

## Troubleshooting

| symptom | fix |
| --- | --- |
| `model … not available` | check `ros doctor`; set `BUILDER_MODEL` / `VERIFIER_MODEL` in `.env` to ids from Vikey `/v1/models` |
| builder keeps failing lint | read the errors — usually an invented number (add the fact or drop the claim) or a cue word that isn't spoken |
| text cut off / overlapping | the verifier usually patches it; otherwise shorten the text (limits in `prompts/builder.md`) |
| no voice in the MP4 | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` missing, or `projects/<slug>/public/vo/*.mp3` incomplete → `ros audio <slug> --force` |
| first render slow | Remotion downloads Chrome Headless Shell once (~90 MB) |
